            <h1>My new journey as a bootcamp student.</h1>
            <p>
                After several months of learning in the Frontend Developer Career Path, I've made the big jump over to the Bootcamp to get<br>
                 expert code reviews of my Solo Projects projects and meet like-minded peers.

                    <br>
                    <br>
                            I like to think of myself as a lifelong learner. I used to spend hours and hours learning, then try to create simple<br>
                            projects using what I learned or work new techniques into existing projects.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                            While that was fun, I felt like it would be helpful to share what I was learning and most things about my journey<br>
                            with the world.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>How I got started</b>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                        I started simple and gradually grew my learning journal site. I would take notes about what I was learning. After<br>
                        each learning session, I'd use my notes to not only reflect on what I learned but also write short summaries of<br>
                        what I learned using my own words.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                        That helped me grok what I was learning, and I realized that posting my learning summaries was also helping<br>
                        others learn and stay motivated.
